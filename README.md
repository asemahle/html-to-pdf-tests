## WkHtmltoPdf
##### Known Cons
- Only a small team actively working on it
- Many known bugs
- Replies to questions are not guaranteed
- Highlighting text in PDF looks bad (try downloading one of the test WK pdfs to see what I mean)

## PrinceXML
##### Known Cons
- Poor Javascript support. Cannot handle highcharts
- CSS for fonts is not as good as WkHtmlToPdf

## DocRaptor
##### Known Cons
- Better JS support than Prince, but not great (will fail to build PDF if *anything* is written to the console)
- CSS for fonts is not as good as WkHtmlToPdf
